4,Which is NOT a typical criterion for selecting an approach?,Correctness,Simplicity,Aesthetics of variable names,Time/space efficiency,C,Variable name aesthetics are secondary.
5,Divide and conquer primarily helps with:,Combining inputs,Breaking problems into subproblems,Increasing code length,Removing constraints,B,It decomposes complex tasks.
6,"In pseudocode, which loop is best when the number of iterations is known?",WHILE,REPEAT-UNTIL,FOR,IF,C,FOR loops fit fixed counts.
7,Which of the following is NOT a flowchart symbol?,Process,Connector,Database,Decision,C,Database is a specialized symbol not needed here.
8,Constraint examination focuses on:,Programmer preferences,Resource limits and requirements,Adding more features,Beautifying code,B,It studies limits like time/memory.
9,Which example best fits 'simplification'?,Ignoring invalid inputs initially,Binary search instead of linear search,Optimizing constants,Parallelizing loops,A,"Start with core happy path, then expand."

11,Key components of IPO are:,"Input, Process, Output","Initialize, Program, Optimize","Index, Pointer, Operand","Input, Program, Output",A,"Correct trio is Input, Process, Output."
12,A flowchart should generally flow:,Bottom to top,Right to left,"Top to bottom, left to right",Randomly,C,Standard readability convention.
13,Which statement is FALSE for algorithms?,They must be unambiguous,They may run forever,They must produce output,They should be effective,B,They must terminate.
14,A good first step before coding is:,Choose variable colors,Draw a flowchart or write pseudocode,Memorize library functions,Write comments only,B,Plan logic via pseudocode/flowcharts.
15,Linear search on an array:,Requires sorted array,Does not require sorted array,Works only with strings,Returns all duplicates always,B,Order is not required for linear search.
16,Which is most relevant to performance constraints?,Font size of code,Time complexity,File extension,Indentation style,B,Performance ties to time complexity.
17,The rectangle in a flowchart denotes:,Input/Output,Process,Decision,Start/End,B,Process step.
18,"In problem analysis, trade-offs are considered while:",Gathering data,Generating alternative methods,Selecting optimum approach,Writing outputs,C,Selection involves trade-offs.
19,"Which technique fits combining small, tested modules?",Divide & Conquer,Constraint Examination,Simplification,Debugging,A,D&C builds from submodules.
