# Unit 1 — Problem Solving & Algorithm
## Learning Objectives
- Understand phases of problem analysis
- Apply problem-solving techniques
- Write algorithms & pseudocode
- Draw flowcharts using standard symbols

---
## Why Problem Analysis?
- Clarify inputs, outputs, constraints
- Avoid rework; plan before code

---
## IPO Model
- Inputs → Processing → Outputs
- Template and example (Grade Calculator)

---
## Problem-Solving Techniques
- Simplification
- Divide & Conquer
- Constraint Examination

---
## Algorithm — Key Properties
- Finiteness, Definiteness, Input, Output, Effectiveness (F-D-I-O-E)

---
## Pseudocode Basics
- Clear names, indentation, control structures

---
## Examples
- Sum of N
- Prime check
- Largest of 3
- Linear search

---
## Flowcharts — Symbols
- Start/End, Input/Output, Process, Decision, Flow lines, Connector

---
## Flowchart Examples
- Area of circle
- Largest of three
- Linear search

---
## Map to C (Preview)
- Sequence, Selection, Iteration
- Arrays & Strings link to later units

---
## Pitfalls & Best Practices
- Avoid coding without IPO
- Start simple, then refine

---
## Quick Practice
- Write IPO + Algorithm + Flowchart for: electricity bill, salary slip
