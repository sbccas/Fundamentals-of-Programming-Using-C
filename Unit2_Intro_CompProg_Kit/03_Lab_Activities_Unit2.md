Unit 2 — Lab Activities & Class Exercises
Prepared: 2025-09-02

Activity 1 — Compare Workflows (Group of 3)
- Task: Each group will write a short 'Hello' program in Python (interpreter) and C (compiler).
- Deliverables: A short note describing the workflow for each language, the error messages seen, and which stage caught the first error.

Activity 2 — Tokenizer (Paper/Small Script)
- Task: Tokenize the expression: `sum = (a1 + 23) * b2 - 45;`
- Output: List of tokens with type (identifier, operator, literal, punctuation).

Activity 3 — Compiler Phases (Diagram)
- Task: Draw the flow of compiler phases for a small program and explain what each phase does in two sentences.

Activity 4 — Bug Hunt (Time-boxed)
- Given: A short C-like code with a logic bug (provided by instructor).
- Task: Design 6 test cases (include boundary values), run the code, identify and fix the bug, and write a short bug report.

Activity 5 — Test Case Design (Individual)
- Given a specification for ATM PIN check (4-digit PIN, 3 attempts then lock), design equivalence partitions and boundary tests, then write acceptance criteria.
