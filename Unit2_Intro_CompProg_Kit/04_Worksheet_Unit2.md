Unit 2 — Worksheet (In-class)
Prepared: 2025-09-02

Part A — Short Answers
1. Define: Program, Assembler, Compiler, Interpreter (one line each).
2. List three differences between compiler and interpreter.
3. What is lexical analysis? Give one example of a token.
4. What are two examples of runtime errors?

Part B — True/False (correct and justify)
1. A compiler executes code line by line at runtime. (T/F)
2. Boundary value analysis tests typical mid-range inputs. (T/F)

Part C — Practical (short tasks)
1. Tokenize: `if (x >= 100) total = total + 1;`
2. Classify the bug: Program compiles but prints wrong sum — syntax/runtime/logic?
3. List 4 test cases to validate a function that returns the maximum of three integers.
